# Website

## TODO

- rename website to dsnn.io
- cleanup test posts
- install and configure gh-pages for release managment
- dark mode toggle
- add Normalize.css
- logo blinks on navigate, something that can be fixed?
- test image Optimizations
- serviceworker? (this is not a PWA but fun with all green in lighthouse)
